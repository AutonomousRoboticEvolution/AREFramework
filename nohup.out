qhull precision warning: 
The initial hull is narrow (cosine of min. angle is 1.0000000000000000).
Is the input lower dimensional (e.g., on a plane in 3-d)?  Qhull may
produce a wide facet.  Options 'QbB' (scale to unit box) or 'Qbb' (scale
last coordinate) may remove this warning.  Use 'Pp' to skip this warning.
